Development Workflow:
=====================

Create a GITHUB Issue before doing any work:
	In VSCode start a new topic branch using the GITHUB Pull request tab
	Do any required testing using MESEN emulator
	Make any changes in vscode src files and run the [1- Compile ROMS] task to build a rom
	Test the rom to verify your changes

If you have added new code via hijack to the rom, the new code and hijack needs to be imported back into DiztinGUISH for markup:
	Set the !DizImport flag = 1 in the DizSettings.asm file of the SRC folder
	backup the NHL '94(USA).sfc file in the root to the Orig_ROMS_For_Comparison folder
	Copy the new compiled rom to the root with the same name NHL '94(USA).sfc
	Load .dizraw file in DiztinGUISH
	Markup all the new code by adding comments or labels as required
	Export to DizExport Folder
	Use beyond compare to compare DizExport folder to Src folder for changes
	Review and copy changes to source
	Run Compile Roms Task in VSCode to verify the rom builds successfully.

When adding a new hack:
 Add the patch to the patches folder
 Add the patch filename to the patches.asm file
 Add any config values to the config.asm
 Add the hack to the GUI c# project
	Add to MultiSelectHacks selection
	Add to EditRomConfigFileMultiHacks
 Build and Test the GUI project (Check in code to branch and build the files from github actions)
	Test from the GUI by building the hack from scrath
	Test from the GUI by applying the hack to an existing rom
	Test to make sure it works with the hack applied and disabled
