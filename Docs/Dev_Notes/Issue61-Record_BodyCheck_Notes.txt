Track Body Checking To Record As Player Stat:

==================================
Body Checking Notes:
==================================

Trace Logs:
IsRead && MemAddress == $017B6 (Ram Address of Total Body Checks Per Team)
ROM Address 9E9BCB Reads the total number of checks and then increments for game stat.
Partial Progress @ ROM Address $9E9B8B The Value of Y is the position on the ice of the player Being Hit. Value of X is the player hitting
For Example PlayerStruct Jer# is 13c3 + x will give you the jersey number of the player performing the hit
For Example PlayerStruct Jer# is 13c3 + y will give you the jersey number of the player being hit.

{$89} = Home/Away Team Performing Hit 0=Home 2=Away
{$91} = Player Hit
{$95} = Player Hitting

13c3 is player struct on ice
12a3 is roster index of player on the ice

{$13c3+[$95]} = Jersy# of Player doing the hit
{$12a3+[$95]} = Player Roster Index -1 of player doing the hit [0 based thats why]
{$13c3+[$91]} = Jersy# of Player being hit
{$12a3+[$91]} = Player Roster Index -1 of player being hit [0 based thats why]

I steal from the Penalty Summary Ram Map as it had room for 60 penalties. I leave room for 20 penalties and steal the remaing bytes for checks for and checks against

$168E-$16C1 Checks For     	26 bytes home team, 26 bytes away team
$16C2-$16F5 Checks Against	26 bytes home team, 26 bytes away team


WRAM Ends at $1FFF

==================================
Penalty Summary Ram MAP:
==================================
Penalty Summary Ram MAP starts @ Wram $163E enough for approx 60 penalties. Each Penalty is 4 bytes.
$163C contains the number of penalties, it just keeps incrementing this number for each penalty then takes the next four available bytes.

==================================
Goals Ram MAP:
==================================
Goals Ram MAP starts @ Wram $18EE 26 bytes home team, 26 bytes away team
Each player has their own byte organized by Team Player Roster Index order
The Goalie bytes contain Goals against
The Player bytes contain Goals

Trace Logs:
ROM Address 9EF4D5 increments the goals for the current player index.

==================================
Shots On Net Ram MAP:
==================================
Shots on Net Ram MAP starts @ Wram $1956 26 bytes home team, 26 bytes away team
Each player has their own byte organized by Team Player Roster Index order
The Goalie bytes contain Shots against
The Player bytes contain Shots On Net

Trace Logs:
ROM Address 9EF2D3 increments the Shots On Goal for the current player index.

==================================
Penality Minutes Ram MAP:
==================================
Penalty Minutes Ram MAP starts @ Wram $198A 26 bytes home team, 26 bytes away team
Each player has their own byte organized by Team Player Roster Index order
The Goalie bytes contain ?
The Player bytes contain Total Penalty Minutes

Trace Logs:
ROM Address 9EB5BF Adds the penalty to the players penalty byte

==================================
Other Notes:
==================================
ROM $9EF213 Start of Function that ends up figuring out who scored the goal before incrementing the Goal Ram Map, or Shot on net?
ROM $9E90AE is part of master function that increments the goal ram map
ROM $9EF226 builds up the player data that just took the shot. {$13c3+[$95]} = jersey # {$12a3+[$95]} = player index on team (-1) $91 Home00 or Away02
