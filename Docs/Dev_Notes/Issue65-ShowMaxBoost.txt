NOTES:

WRAM Map of Random Numbers from -12 to +12 
$1A12 to $1C81 622 Bytes populated from code address $9FE0EB
$14 populated from code address $9FCF23. Used As Base RNG # Per Player.
$9FCEF6 Main Loop Called for Each Player On The Ice, Or When A New Player Comes On The Ice
$9F99D2 Loads Players RNG from $1A12 to $1C81 to figure out edit lines value.
$9F9ABD Checks to see if it needs to cap or min attribute value

Formula the game uses for attributes in edit lines / Team Roster
18*attribute value (0 to 6) + Hold/Cold RNG (-12 to +12)
Example 18*4+10 = 82 in edit lines for a 4 of 6 attribute with a + 10 RNG

Hot/Cold Function (A,Y,$14)
	Input:
		A 	= Current Attribute Value before hot/cold
		Y 	= Current Attribute Index Zero based (12 Attributes)
		$14	= Base Index to Players RNG (Different for each player)
	Outputs:
		A	= Players New Attribute Value
	
	$16 = Stores Players Attribute Value before hot/cold applied
	Y 	= $14 + Current Attribute Index
	$1A12 + Y = RNG
	
	
Goal:
	Extract Real Player Attributes per player from the save state (WRAM)
		Identify WRAM Map [Done]
		Understand how $14 is populated per player []
		Test the theroy of extracting each players real attributes []
